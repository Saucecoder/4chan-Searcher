A simple 4chan searcher - Chaazd

Isn't great since it picks up anything in a thread, so if anyone
even mentions your keyword it will return the thread.
----------------------------------------------------

As prompted by the terminal, first enter the board you wish to search.
-Type 'v' as opposed to '/v/'
Then enter your keywords.It will split and search them individually. Do not put spaces!
-Enter like so: Minecraft,minecraft,general,build
It will create a text file in the current directory if it finds a thread and will put it there.
All threads found prior will also be put into this file. I advise you clean it out after every 
search. The reason I've done this is because there is no nice way to copy/paste things from the terminal.
However, It will still display the results in the terminal window.
-----------------------------------------------------
Using 'v' as the board, and 'Minecraft,minecraft' as the keywords,
I got this results.txt

These threads will have all 404'd by the time anyone(if they do) sees this, but as you can see, it is 
pretty efficient.
